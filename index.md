# Online Indoctrination: How Extremist Pipelines Recruit and How We Can Intervene

## Introduction

The word _indoctrination_ is not new, but it is becoming urgent in a new way. Indoctrination is the systematic shaping of beliefs using persuasion, social pressure, and curated information streams. In the U.S. we increasingly see violent acts committed by people, often very young, who have been systematically indoctrinated. That is to say they are drawn into extremist belief systems through curated content, social pressure, and community incentives; often via ordinary social platforms. Many of us, especially our elders, do not realize how this process unfolds in digital spaces that seem, at first glance, like harmless jokes, memes, or gaming chats. This post is an attempt to explain what is happening and what we can do about it.

**Scope note**: I am deliberately setting aside gun-policy debates and partisan score-keeping, not because they are unimportant, but because they tend to consume the oxygen and distract from other factors worthy of consideration, such as how isolation, identity-seeking, and algorithmic ecosystems are exploited to groom vulnerable people into extremist worldviews and behavior. This post focuses on mechanisms and prevention steps that families, schools, platforms, and communities can act on now, regardless of party or policy preferences.
